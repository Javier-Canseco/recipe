Bolón de Verde

Mashed green plantain balls with melty cheese. Crispy outside, soft inside.

You will need
	•	2 green plantains
	•	1 cup crumbled queso fresco or mozzarella
	•	2 to 3 tablespoons butter or oil
	•	Salt and black pepper
	•	Optional: cooked bacon bits or pork rinds, hot sauce, lime

Simple steps
	1.	Prep the plantains
Cut off the ends. Score the peel lengthwise. Pry off the skin. Slice into thick coins.
	2.	Cook
Heat a large skillet with 2 tablespoons oil over medium. Fry the plantain slices until soft and lightly golden, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.
	3.	Mash
Move the hot plantains to a bowl. Add butter, a good pinch of salt, and a little pepper. Mash until mostly smooth with a few small chunks.
	4.	Mix in the cheese
Fold in the crumbled cheese. Add bacon or pork rinds if you like.
	5.	Shape
With clean hands, press into firm balls about the size of a tennis ball. You can make patties if that is easier.
	6.	Crisp
Add a little more oil to the skillet. Brown the balls or patties for 1 to 2 minutes per side to set the shape and melt the cheese.
	7.	Serve
Eat hot. Great with a fried egg, a squeeze of lime, and a little hot sauce.
